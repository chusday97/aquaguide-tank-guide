## 2026-08-25 — Progress unification started

- Created `codex/unified-rc-visual-v1` from `37a8d4d1` after user confirmed the 4317 interactive preview as the correct visual result.
- Recorded `integration/aquaguide-rc1@895f2f39` as a selective business reference only.
- Recorded PR #140 as deprecated because its RC-first partial UI migration regressed the approved visual result.
- Audited RC-only commits and grouped them into domain authority, recommendation, UI, interactive atlas, runtime/API, and workflow integrity categories.
- Closed PR #140 and opened Draft PR #141 against `integration/aquaguide-rc1`.
- Confirmed that P0 migration expands `LifeStage`, evidence data and planning semantics; paused code migration pending the required contract confirmation.
- Added local/CI checks that report canonical branch, SHA, approved visual baseline, RC business reference and Draft PR.

## 2026-08-25 — Daily local worktree aligned

- Switched `/Users/chuchu/Documents/New project/aquaguide_frontend` from legacy `codex/rc1-visual-integration` to `codex/unified-rc-visual-v1`.
- Verified local `HEAD` and `origin/codex/unified-rc-visual-v1` both resolve to `5b619a08`; `npm run project:status` reports `dirty: false`.
- The approved 4317 preview remains isolated on the user-approved visual baseline and was not changed.

## 2026-08-25 — Unified branch CI verified

- Added the canonical branch push trigger to `RC Convergence V1`, because a PR-only workflow not present on the default branch does not provide a usable gate for this Draft PR.
- GitHub Actions run `32846848569` passed: canonical-state check, lint, layout-mode contract, three-stage framing contract, and production build.

## 2026-08-25 — Open PR topology archived

- Queried 56 open GitHub PRs and recorded `.ai/OPEN_PR_REGISTRY.md`.
- Designated #141 as the only active convergence entry; the other 55 PRs remain traceable historical inputs and are not direct merge sources.
- No historical PR was closed or otherwise modified.

## 2026-08-25 — Supabase deployment status corrected

- The user confirmed that the existing Supabase work had already been deployed.
- Corrected the status distinction: deployed Supabase is a user-confirmed fact; re-validating the exact connected environment, schema revision and RLS behavior from the unified branch remains a separate verification task.

## 2026-08-25 — Truth consolidation phase 1 started

- Added canonical project, product, visual and deployment documentation routes.
- Reclassified the dated current-product snapshot as historical evidence; no product code, Supabase configuration or accepted visual baseline changed.

## 2026-08-25 — Truth consolidation phase 2 started

- Added a historical-evidence registry and supersession headers for legacy progress, Handoff, UI audit and cloud-planning records.
- No historical file was deleted; the change makes their evidence role explicit.

## 2026-08-25 — Truth consolidation phase 3 started

- Added `docs/05-validation/VISUAL_ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX.md` to connect the user-confirmed 4317 UI baseline to regression commands, routes and human-review status.
- Verified the local baseline: layout 6/6, framing, UI governance, interactive scenes, persistent detail rail, and page runtime matrix 28/28 all passed.

## 2026-08-25 — Truth consolidation phase 4 started

- Added `FEATURE_CATALOG.md` as the single module-status inventory and removed the duplicate capability table from Product Truth.

## 2026-08-25 — Truth consolidation phase 5 audited

- Verified non-secret evidence: 18 tracked migrations, the 31-table three-tier contract test, configured Vercel Production Supabase/Postgres variable names, and a Ready unified-branch Preview.
- Recorded exact deployed schema/RLS/SHA parity as an authorized read-only verification still required; no redeploy or configuration change was attempted.

## 2026-08-25 — Truth consolidation phase 6 started

- Added PR evidence template, delivery protocol and a deterministic project-truth verifier.
- Read the RC branch-protection API: the branch is not protected. Recorded the safe prerequisite rather than enabling a check that could block all PRs before it is runnable from the base branch.

## 2026-08-25 — Truth consolidation phase 7 contract drafted

- Read the RC domain-rule and evidence source; created a `PROPOSED` contract with exact types, no SQL/API/persistence change and explicit UI exclusions.
- No P0 product code was migrated. User approval is required before this contract changes implementation or `CONTRACT.md`.

## 2026-08-25 — Truth consolidation phase 8 gate established

- Added `RELEASE_READINESS.md`; the unified line is intentionally `NOT_READY` until exact deployment parity, authorized Supabase parity, P0 contract implementation and a separate release acceptance are complete.

## 2026-08-25 — Accepted P0 compatibility authority migration

- **Approval:** 用户明确批准 `docs/decisions/P0_COMPATIBILITY_CONTRACT.md`。
- **Action:** 迁入本地 `CompatibilityLifeStage` 输入、审核阶段风险证据、纯 tank-state / water-change / bioload 规则和从既有鱼缸、诊断事实派生的服务；共享 `LifeStage` 保持 API/数据库原枚举，未导入 RC 页面、CSS、API、迁移、RLS 或写入逻辑。
- **Verification:** `lint`、兼容性 16/16、tank-state 11/11、water-change 8/8、three-tier contract、production build 通过；4320 临时 build preview 的 layout、framing、interactive scenes、page runtime matrix 通过。
- **Remote:** 尚未推送本次产品代码；`main` 未修改，发布仍受 Supabase parity 和单独 release acceptance 阻断。
- **Independent review:** Critic initially found incomplete structured diagnosis mapping, a legacy bioload threshold regression, a shared lifecycle/API boundary leak, and free-text false positives. The builder restored the legacy multiplier, isolated `CompatibilityLifeStage`, mapped current structured question fields, excluded free text, and added regressions; the same Critic recheck passed.
