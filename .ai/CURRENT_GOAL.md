# Current Goal

Updated: 2026-09-04
Canonical repo: `chusday97/aquaguide-tank-guide`
Branch: `feature/admin-content-v0`
Broader architecture: `.ai/AQUA_OPERATIONS_STUDIO_ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Current objective
Mature Aqua Admin from a Species-SEO-focused publication tool into **Aqua Operations Studio** without breaking the already-working SEO subsystem.

The immediate technical priority is now **P1 Change Impact Preview**: make decision-critical edits show their affected frontend/runtime consumers before release. Product/Care authority convergence and the first authenticated SEO operating cycle are already closed.

## Why this is now P0
Verified current code still has direct static frontend authorities:
- Encyclopedia → `src/data/fishData.ts`
- Care Encyclopedia → `src/data/careTopicsData.ts`
while Product/Care Admin writes through `/admin/species` and `/admin/care-articles`.

Until those paths converge, `/admin/product-content` cannot be called a mature live CMS authority even though its edit/publish API exists.
## Stable subsystem that must not regress
Species SEO remains Repo-backed and fail-closed:
- private Draft/review/import-batch authority;
- CSV preflight + Diff;
- evidence-based duplicate review;
- batch-scoped editorial review;
- bilingual Staging readiness;
- exact Staging allowlist + Canonical dependency validation;
- Production locked.

## Next milestones
1. [DONE locally] Define one published Product/Care read contract, inventory direct static consumers, and isolate Draft from the last Published snapshot.
2. [DONE locally] Converge Encyclopedia Product and Care Encyclopedia/Aquarium/Identify diagnosis reads onto the published runtime authority with explicit static fallback.
3. [DONE locally] Prove Product and Care Save→Publish→Preview boundaries with user-state and Compatibility isolation.
4. [DONE] Complete the 14-Species bilingual SEO batch-01 operating cycle on authenticated Preview; 28/28 hosted EN/ZH pages passed acceptance.
5. [NEXT] Add change-impact classification/Preview before decision-critical Product Data changes can be released broadly.
6. Build Compatibility Admin only after Product Data authority is stable.

## Safety
No Production unlock. No blind main merge/rebase. No SEO field may become authority for decision-critical Product Data or Compatibility Rules.

## 2026-09-04 implementation state
Functional checkpoint `d6d2b37e` adds publication snapshots and Draft isolation. Public API routes now prefer the immutable published snapshot, while pre-migration published rows remain a compatibility fallback. The database migration is committed but not applied to Production. Runtime bootstrap now prefers the published Product/Care API; Encyclopedia Product plus Care Encyclopedia/Aquarium/Identify diagnosis consume that runtime catalog. Browser injection acceptance passed for zh-CN Product/Care and English Care. Production migration remains unapplied; the next P0 is a real Admin edit/save/publish → Preview proof.

## 2026-09-04 Product/Care P0 acceptance
- Controlled browser Preview proves Product and Care Save remain invisible until Publish, then advance the intended runtime consumer.
- Care hardcoded display-title overrides were corrected so published Care titles are not masked by legacy presentation maps.
- `aquarium_app_state_v1` remains byte-identical across Admin Save/Publish and before/after user Preview loads.
- Published Product hydration mutates only `runtimeFishData`; static `fishData` used by Compatibility remains unchanged.
- This closes the defined Product/Care P0 target locally. Production migration/deployment remains intentionally untouched.

## 2026-09-04 SEO operational acceptance + CI cost control
- Authenticated batch-01 completed for zh-CN and en: 14 Species × 2 locales, with durable batch scope and 14 Base groups per locale.
- One explicit Staging snapshot publish created commit `7aaeb44e02ce6b82ba35919b081945bf4d0ce1cd`; Production remained locked.
- Hosted deployment `dpl_B86KiBaD75LhGdcHMa6v8zTN6pJM` passed 28/28 page checks for metadata, H1, Product facts, canonical/hreflang, robots, CTA and content hygiene.
- CI is now split into light default checks and gated heavy Golden/Visual/evaluation/browser checks.
