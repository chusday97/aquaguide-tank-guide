## Current product definition
AquaGuide is not only a Species-information product and this Admin is not only an SEO CMS. The target operating model is **Aqua Operations Studio** with separate authorities for Product Data, Care Knowledge, Compatibility Rules, SEO Editorial and controlled publishing.
## Authority boundaries
- Product Data: scientific identity, temperature, pH, tank size, temperament, feeding, housing facts, images. Current operator surface: `/admin/product-content` → Species.
- Care Knowledge: symptoms, actions, avoid/observe/escalate/next-step playbooks. Current operator surface: `/admin/product-content` → Care.
- Compatibility Rules: behavior profiles, pair rules, evidence, confidence, rule versions. Product runtime exists; mature operator UI does not yet exist.
- SEO Editorial: SEO Title, Meta, H1, Intro, Image Alt, localized display copy, canonical/index policy. Authority: `/admin/seo/`.
- User Context: aquarium/livestock/reminders/history. This is user data, not CMS content.

SEO is downstream acquisition content. Editing SEO must not mutate Product Data, compatibility decisions, care logic or stored user state.

## Latest P0-A implementation checkpoint
- Full direct runtime consumer inventory is now canonical in `.ai/PUBLISHED_CONTENT_AUTHORITY.md`.
- Product/Care public read contract is defined: public API is the published authority; static datasets are seed/audit/offline fallback only.
- Added immutable `content_publications` snapshots plus service-role-only publish/archive RPCs in migration `202609040001_product_care_publication_snapshots.sql`.
- Editing an already-published Species/Care record now preserves its last public snapshot and moves the editable row back to Draft; Save no longer intentionally advances public content.
- Public `/species` and `/care-articles` routes now prefer publication snapshots and retain a migration-order fallback to legacy published rows.
- Local API typecheck, publication contract test, root build, Admin UI regression and SEO handoff all pass. Migration has not been applied to Production.
- Primary Encyclopedia/Care/diagnosis runtime consumers are converged and controlled Admin Save→Publish→Preview acceptance now passes for Product and Care.

## Product/Care P0 status after runtime convergence
The primary target consumers are now routed through the published runtime catalog:
- Encyclopedia Product Data → published Product API/runtime catalog.
- Care Encyclopedia → published Care API/runtime catalog.
- Aquarium and Identify diagnosis Care Knowledge → the same published Care runtime catalog.
- Static Product/Care datasets remain explicit seed/offline fallback, not the successful live authority.

Controlled Preview acceptance now proves Save stays private, Publish advances the intended Product/Care consumer, user aquarium state remains unchanged, and Compatibility static authority is not mutated. This is local/controlled acceptance only; Production migration/deployment was not performed.
## Species SEO subsystem — stable baseline
- Private Draft/review/revision/import-batch authority: `chusday97/aquaguide-seo-content / seo-admin-drafts`.
- Public AquaGuide repo receives only code + explicit sanitized Staging snapshot.
- Supabase Species SEO paths are historical/compatibility only; Repo-backed authority is canonical.
- CSV flow: blank template → preflight → field Diff → Create Draft.
- Durable `import_batches` scope bulk review and Staging publication; server rejects out-of-batch review/publish writes.
- Duplicate review uses evidence cards, real Preview, explainable recommendation and no-write defer.
- Staging requires bilingual page/Base approvals, hygiene gates, exact batch allowlist and required Canonical dependencies.
- Production remains locked.

## Species SEO operational proof — completed 2026-09-04
- Authenticated zh-CN import batch: `batch-20260904132705-deca`; 14 Species / 14 Base groups; final status Approved.
- Authenticated English import batch: `batch-20260904132732-9d0d`; same 14 Species / 14 Base groups; final status Staging Published.
- Explicit Staging publication commit: `7aaeb44e02ce6b82ba35919b081945bf4d0ce1cd` on `feature/admin-content-v0`; sanitized snapshot path `content/species-seo/staging-snapshot.json`.
- Hosted Vercel deployment: `dpl_B86KiBaD75LhGdcHMa6v8zTN6pJM` / `aquaguide-bds0xiu0q-chusday97s-projects.vercel.app`.
- Hosted acceptance: 28/28 EN/ZH pages passed title/meta/H1, Product facts, canonical/hreflang, robots, CTA and internal-copy hygiene checks.
- Existing historical `sp_0001` acceptance/test Drafts were outside both batch scopes and were not published.
- Production remained locked throughout.

## CI operating policy — 2026-09-04
- Normal pushes/PRs run lightweight checks only: Admin contract/build, product fast contracts, lint/typecheck, root build, generated-data/diff hygiene.
- Heavy Golden / Visual / evaluation-history / browser suites run only on `workflow_dispatch`, merge queue (`merge_group`), or PRs labeled `run-heavy-ci` / `merge-ready`.
- Existing workflow/check identities are preserved where possible so branch rules do not silently break.
- Heavy tests were not deleted; local entrypoint validation passed before commit.

## Next implementation order
P0-A — Product/Care authority convergence:
- [done locally] published-content read contract + Draft isolation;
- [done locally] Encyclopedia Product + Care Encyclopedia/Aquarium/Identify diagnosis runtime cutover with explicit fallback;
- [done locally] stateful browser Preview proves Admin Product/Care Save→Publish behavior plus user-state/Compatibility isolation.

P0-B — [DONE] Authenticated bilingual batch-01 import/review/Staging/28-page hosted acceptance.

P1 — Change Impact Preview: [DONE first round] field classification + affected-consumer summary; [NEXT] user-facing before/after Preview for decision-critical edits, then Compatibility-result regression simulation.

P1 — Compatibility Admin: reviewed Species behavior profiles, Pair Rules, Evidence, Confidence and Rule Version with regression testing before publish.

P2 — unified Publish Center, stronger permissions/audit, then AI-assisted extraction/conflict detection/Draft generation from approved facts.

## Branch / safety
- Live `main`: `64fa58a16a723b74621ac1db513adb1efb47e282`.
- Feature remote before this docs sync: `e58c70829b389b6a9a7b23fd9519afd96c802702`.
- Current measured divergence against live main and local functional HEAD: main-only 269 / feature-only 117 commits; merge base `ed0cf38025652db901ee81aa697ca55b1c1584b6`.
- Do not blindly merge/rebase main; dedicated reconciliation is required after operational acceptance.
- Do not unlock Production, bypass Admin authentication, or write private Draft content to the public repo.
## Known operational data that must not be forgotten
- Prepared corrected batch-01 files live under `~/aquaguide-seo-batches/batch-01/`; 14 low-risk Species × zh-CN/en; isolated 28-page dry-run passed.
- Real duplicate decisions already recorded for 3 source sets: keep `sp_0001` (极火虾), `sp_0214` (白金西非凤凰), `sp_0082` (黑木蕨). Do not overwrite these decisions during UI testing.
- Existing `sp_0001` private Drafts contain historical acceptance/test wording in Chinese/English. Do not publish that content to Production; hygiene gates should remain fail-closed.
- Source identity gate blocks incomplete scientific names such as trailing `var.` / `subsp.` / `ssp.` markers.

## Execution style for next session
Start with live state reads, not memory. Continue the first incomplete P0 unless the user supplies a newer concrete bug. Do not reimplement stable SEO features. Update this handoff plus `CURRENT_GOAL`, `TASK_QUEUE`, `LIVE_STATUS`, `BRANCH_STATUS` and `EXECUTION_LOG` after material changes.

## Cross-session recovery anchor
For a brand-new conversation, start with `.ai/CROSS_SESSION_START.md`. It contains the exact canonical read order, current first P0, safety rules and a copy-paste startup prompt. This file remains the detailed handoff; `CROSS_SESSION_START.md` is the stable entry point.

## 2026-09-04 Product/Care controlled Preview acceptance
- Product: Admin edit/save returns Draft; pre-Publish Encyclopedia Preview still shows old public name; after Publish a fresh Preview shows the new public name.
- Care: same Save/private → Publish/public sequence verified against Care Guide.
- Fixed a real hidden P0 bug uncovered by stricter acceptance: hardcoded common-guide display titles could mask an Admin-published Care title. Published Care now wins; legacy title maps apply only to fallback content.
- Search suggestion presentation now preserves published Product/Care names/categories instead of reapplying legacy English translation maps.
- User aquarium local state and Compatibility static inputs remain unchanged.
- Functional acceptance commit: `ee2fcc8a test(content): prove admin publish preview boundary`.
- Product/Care and SEO P0 are closed. The first unfinished milestone is P1 decision-critical before/after Preview; do not touch Production.

## 2026-09-04 Change Impact Preview first round
- Functional commit: `e58c7082 feat(admin): add change impact preview`.
- Product/Care editor now computes field-level Diff and classifies changes as display-only, decision-critical Product Data or Care workflow. Compatibility/SEO categories remain explicit independent authorities.
- Impact UI separates `发布后直接更新` from `需单独复核`; Product changes never claim to auto-mutate Compatibility or SEO.
- Existing public `/species/:catalogKey` and `/care-articles/:catalogKey` detail reads provide the published baseline, so Draft-vs-Published Diff survives refresh.
- Product browser acceptance proves name Diff survives save + reload; Care acceptance proves workflow changes expose Care Guide / Aquarium / Identify as direct consumers. 1280px and 390px layouts pass.
- Admin CI path filters now include Product/Care Admin page/services/impact test; ordinary pushes still run the lightweight job only.
- Remaining P1 work: full user-facing before/after Preview for decision-critical changes, then Compatibility-result regression checks before release.
